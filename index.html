  <p>Twice a year, the fashion industry’s biggest names show their latest trendsetters for the world to marvel at. Male and female models and personalities go down the runway amid a sea of camera flashes and awe from the audience. The event isn’t an actual contest, but there’s real pressure on brands and designers to dictate what’s hot until the next one. <b>That’s the gist of Fashion Week,</b> a weeklong fashion show that occurs across the globe. For all intents and purposes, one designer summed its purpose perfectly: why make clothes if they won’t be paraded? Amid the rising costs of hosting one, Fashion Week is the ideal way for a brand or designer to secure recognition in the <i>$1.53-trillion</i> global fashion industry. But where did the biannual tradition of showing off new fashion trends start? Here’s an in-depth look at how Fashion Week grew to the prestige it enjoys today.</p>
    <h4>Pomp and splendor</h4>
    <p>If you were to go back to the earliest instances of people showing their tastes in fashion, you’d have to go back to ancient times. No fashion shows existed, but the practice of flaunting one’s wealth and social status extended to clothing. In Ancient Greece and Rome, nothing screamed prestige more than luxurious tunics. While also worn by commoners, the tunic denoted the wearer’s social status based on its dimensions and decoration or a lack thereof. Wealthy citizens wore tunics almost touching the ground, while senators wore colored bands called laticlaves on their long tunics to indicate their authority. Tunics continued to be worn after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, with the eastern half (later known as the Byzantine Empire) continuing the trend. Like the Romans, the Byzantines donned lavish tunic decorations to signify social status. They continued to be worn following the fall of Constantinople in 1453, though the affluent would slowly move away from them. It wouldn’t be until over 100 years later that tunics—now called chemises—saw a renaissance. Renowned designers like Cristobal Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent introduced it into their clothing lines, the latter making it to suit the bohemian lifestyle.</p>
